/**
 *In the classic problem of the Towers of Hanoi, 
 *you have 3 rods and N disks of different sizes which can slide onto any tower. 
 *The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending order of size from top to bottom 
 *(e.g., each disk sits on top of an even larger one). You have the following constraints:
 *
 * only one disk can be moved at a time
 * A disk is slid off the top of one rod onto the next rod
 * A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk
 * 
 *用栈来解决汉诺塔问题，而不是递归
